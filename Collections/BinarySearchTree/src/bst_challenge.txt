Manual TreeMap Challenge 

Code represents binary search tree, or TreeMap.
Each node is represented with int value, to make data as simple as possible. 
Data used in tree is illustrated in jpg file.
Challenge was to write a method which removes node with given value from the tree.
Search method was corrected as well. 
BinaryTree class is created to handle cases when root is empty.
